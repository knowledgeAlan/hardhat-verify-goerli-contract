# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
 npx hardhat run scripts/deployNft.ts --network goerli

npx hardhat verify --network goerli  0xd166A1870900666572F986084111F463073cf2Fb
